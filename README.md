- 👋 Hi, I’m @jaflowers1014. I'm an a full-time practicing attorney, father to two girls, and I'm looking to learn more to differentiate myself in my field. 
- 👀 I’m interested in educating myself to either pivot into becoming a full-time developer or merging my coding skill into a new legal-adjacent postion. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Web Development, eventually SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on contract-based Python projects to grow my portfolio of work.
